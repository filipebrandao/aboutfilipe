## About my work
I'm a passionate software engineer who's been coding for more than half of his life and who always puts quality first. The key strengths that I possess include:
	- 🌍 I have successfully designed, developed, and maintained Android apps deployed all around the globe.
	- 📈 I strive for continued excellence and improvement, I care a lot about both internal and external software quality. I also make sure my code is SOLID and I'm passionate about software architecture.
    - 🤖 I have professional experience with Android development for 10+ years (since Android 2) which gives me a deep understanding of the platform itself and the full lifecycle of a software development project (be it in a Agile or more traditional approach).
    - 💯 Throughout my career I participated in smaller projects doing backend and frontend development which provides me a more holistic view over software.
    - 👬 I have worn many hats, also in non-technical ways, from mentoring coworkers to being assigned roles of leadership, which allowed me to code-centric tasks and build a larger set of skills.
