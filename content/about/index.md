## About my work
I'm a passionate software engineer who's been coding for more than half of his life and who always puts quality first. The key strengths that I possess include:
  - 🌍 I have successfully designed, developed, and maintained Android apps deployed all around the globe.
  - 👬 I have been leading a team of developers for more than two years now, which allowed me to build a larger set of skills by detaching from code-centric tasks helping me find the passion for People.
  - 📈 I strive for continued excellence and improvement, I care a lot about both internal and external software quality. I also make sure my code is SOLID.
  - 🤖 I have experience with Android development for 8+ years (since Android 2) which gives me a deep understanding of the platform itself and the full lifecycle of a software development project (be it in a Agile or more traditional approach).
  - 💯 Throughout my career I participated in smaller projects doing backend and frontend development which provides me a more holistic view over software.
  
  I'm interested in challenging today's work boundaries by making the remote-first paradigm shift a reality.

## Hobbies 
Even though I initially present myself through my job and nationality, we all know that's only the tip of the iceberg of who someone really is. Or it should be.
